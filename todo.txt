Things that Need to Added/Improved Upon, May 20th, 2015:

1. Critical Point needs to made semiflexible friendly:
	- Can either pull it from the spinodal binodal, or generate a standalone
	- standalone is probably better, but might have more numerical mess

2. Seperate Fully-Flexible from Semiflexible
	- More of a neatness issue

3. Try to better structure the flipper nonsense
	- Too involved, need to make global or something
	- Also too dependent with too many shortcuts, all around bad

4. Improve numerical stability
	- Hardest to fix.

5. Tabulate actual values again for more advanced semiflexible polymers
