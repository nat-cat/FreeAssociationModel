# FreeAssociationModel
Adds the free association model as a module to the Polymer Project

So the files that actually differ from the original files are as follows:

fiveModels.py adds a fifth model to flory.py

nateFunctions.py is the list of helper functions for the free association model

in templates:  
floryHugs.html is the html file for the free association module
floryHugsplot.html specifies details for the free association graphs
